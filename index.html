        <h3>About Me</h1> 
          <p>
            I am a graduate of the Computer Systems Technology 2-year diploma from Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I excel at problem solving and programming, luckily those skills go hand-in-hand! 
            Before my start at Saskpolytech, I always had a knack for logic and mathematics- I won the Fr. Albert Ruetz Mathematics Scholarship in 2013 for my grades in highschool. 
            <br /><br />
            But this Hacker Hotshot isn't all left-brained! I am also creative and artistic- I am a very visual thinker, which shows in both my work and methodologies. I am capable at creating and visualizing diagrams, interface mockups, and algorithms. 
            <br /><br />
            I admit that I do not have a long track record in this field yet, but I am just getting started, and I am ready to learn and grow!

        <h3>Hobbies</h1> 
          <p>
            Games of all kind are my passion! I love to play video games, and creating a game of my own someday is a passion of mine! When I was in high school, I learned about variables from fiddling around in RPGMaker before we ever saw them in Math class! 
            <br /><br />
            A good Table-Top RolePlaying Game (TTRPG) tickles my fancy just as well as their electronic counterparts. I am the Dungeon Master of a homebrew campaign for 5 players, which has allowed me to flex my creative and social muscles! 
            <br /><br />
            When I am not playing games, I like to draw or go for walks in the park near my house here in Saskatoon. I also read (albeit mostly manga), visit friends, and like everybody else these days- binge some streaming content! 
            (Though I probably watch more DnD content than most)

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            If you're looking for a strong programmer with a creative flair, look no further! But you don't have to take my word for it: please take a look at some of the work I have accomplished in this portfolio to see for yourself!
